From our earliest days, we pioneered the use of predictive modeling to individually personalize credit card offers, turning the entire industry on its head. As we've grown bigger, we've found more and more ways to use technology and face-to-face conversations to understand the human problems associated with money and finances. In the Consumer Bank, we've combined this human-centered approach with our heritage of data-driven decision making to design, build and test our way to truly enabling financial experiences. We've challenged ourselves to spend less time planning, more time doing, and, above all else, to see the world through the eyes of our customers as they work to understand and manage their money. Are you passionate about improving the way people interact with their money? Are you driven by the delight you bring to customers? Do you keep asking, \"why,\" until you hit the root? It's common to fall in love with solutions, but have you ever fallen in love with the problem? Do you have an opinion on whether shipping is more important than perfection? Do you have a healthy dose of skepticism for the impossible? If you're nodding your head, then we want you! As a Product Manager focusing on our Consumer Bank products, you'll be joining a passionate team of product managers, designers, engineers, data scientists, and analysts working to redefine how millions of customers interact with their money. You might work on developing the next generation of our mobile UI. You might solve the gnarly problems presented by a fleet of ATMs. You might reimagine the digital tools in our branches and cafes. You might empower the entire business with better platforms. You might protect our customers from the bad guys. You might build machine learning models to solve problems we haven't even discovered yet. One thing is for sure: you will dream and you will ship. On any given day in the Bank you'll be: Empowered. Part of a team driving the bank's omni-channel servicing portfolio responsible for setting and delivering an experience framework on how our customers should be serviced in both digital and digital-human interactions Learning constantly. Work deeply with customers, associates, designers, technologists and data scientists to build cutting edge solutions Innovating relentlessly. Pushing big change by asking bold questions; starting small, testing, and learning your way to something dramatically better Sharing openly. Telling stories that change the way people think about building products and solving problems, and that illustrate the power of what software can do to make them even better Connecting creatively. Jumpstarting a self-supporting community by sowing the right seeds, building the right tools, integrating the right off-the-shelf products and just plain elbow grease Succeeding strategically. Solving the right problem and holding on the wrong one. Here is what you will bring to the table: Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your crazy idea, or follow an email chain for weeks to find someone with an answer. Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. You dug up a hidden feature in an API that let you do something really cool or introduced a new routine that broke down silos led to better decisions. Passionate. You care about growing others and bringing them together around what's possible. You've started meetup groups or taught General Assembly courses because you love enabling others. Communicator. You can communicate complex ideas clearly, your team knows their priorities and why they're doing what they're doing. Maybe you're an introvert, or maybe you're an extrovert, but nobody accuses you of keeping them out of the"}, "skillslist": {"skill": [{"id": "30919", "name": "Machine learning", "shortname": "Machine learning", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "34400", "name": "Data science", "shortname": "Data science", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "40674", "name": "Testing", "shortname": "Testing", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "40925", "name": "Innovation", "shortname": "Innovation", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "44101", "name": "Shipping", "shortname": "Shipping", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "47065", "name": "Machine learning models", "shortname": "Machine learning models", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "31096", "name": "Problem solving", "shortname": "Problem solving", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "31219", "name": "Decision making", "shortname": "Decision making", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "32974", "name": "Creativity", "shortname": "Creativity", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "33740", "name": "Product management", "shortname": "Product management", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "33807", "name": "Predictive modeling", "shortname": "Predictive modeling", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "35994", "name": "Retail banking", "shortname": "Retail banking", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44171", "name": "Curiosity", "shortname": "Curiosity", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44176", "name": "Data-driven", "shortname": "Data-driven", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44220", "name": "Extroverted", "shortname": "Extroverted", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44222", "name": "Face-to-face conversations", "shortname": "Face-to-face conversations", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44298", "name": "Passion", "shortname": "Passion", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44305", "name": "Planning", "shortname": "Planning", "type": "SOFT"}]}, "certificationslist": null, "seniority": {"id": "0", "code": "0", "label": "No level"}, "occupation": {"soc": {"code": "99999901", "label": "Work from Home - Non-Specific Duties", "revision": "2011"}, "occupation": {"code": "99999901", "label": "Work from Home - Non-Specific Duties", "revision": "2011"}}, "industry": {"code": "0", "label": "Unspecified", "revision": "2012"}, "omjindustries": null, "function": {"id": "0", "label": ""}, "employer": {"id": "32138", "name": "Capital One", "superaliasid": "32138", "superalias": "Capital One"}, "education": {"id": "8", "label": "High school diploma or equivalent"}, "locations": {"location": [{"city": {"id": "27428", "code": "2756896", "label": "Saint Cloud"}, "state": {"id": "24", "code": "27", "label": "MN"}, "county": {"id": "1316", "code": "27009", "label": "Benton County"}, "wib": {"id": "0", "code": "00000", "label": "Unavailable"}, "msa": {"id": "329", "code": "41060", "label": "St. Cloud"}, "superregion": {"code": "", "label": ""}, "country": {"id": "1", "code": "US", "label": "United States"}, "position": {"latitude": "45.52669906616211", "longitude": "-94.17109680175781"}}]}, "salaries": {"salary": [{"id": "2", "type": "Modeled", "value": "0"}, {"id": "3", "type": "BLS", "value": "0"}]}, "jobtypes": {"jobtype": [{"id": "4", "label": "Full-Time"}, {"id": "1", "label": "Permanent"}]}, "colleges": {"college": [{"id": ""}]}, "tags": null, "workkeys": null, "sources": {"source": [{"id": "1300", "jobid": "4775494598", "tags": "", "type": "Niche", "name": "US.jobs", "url": "https://de.jobsyn.org/10ba37ac35f142cea3483cccf4a54a4c1387", "validlink": true}]}, "jobscore": {"value": ""}}, {"id": "4775302759", "hash": "2769673663", "refnumber": "", "isstaffing": true, "isanonymous": false, "isthirdparty": false, "isinappropriate": false, "isbulk": false, "isaggregator": false, "isfree": false, "isclassifiedoccupation": true, "isclassifiedindustry": false, "iscurrent": true, "dates": {"firstseen": "2021-03-26", "lastseen": "2021-03-26", "posted": "2021-03-26", "refreshed": "2021-03-26"}, "title": {"value": "Reception/Office Assistant", "titleid": "269062", "cleantitleid": "12100192", "semicleantitleid": "16197"}, "description": {"value": "Share Top Job Located in Saint Cloud, MN Salary: $15-$17 We have an immediate need for a part-time reception/office support associate for the next 1-3 months.

Unfair discrimination against persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses prohibited. 753. Factors to be considered concerning a previous criminal conviction; presumption. 754. Written statement upon denial of license or employment. 755. Enforcement. \u00a7750. Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (1) \"Public agency\" means the state or any local subdivision thereof, or any state or local department, agency, board or commission. (2) \"Private employer\" means any person, company, corporation, labor organization or association which employs ten or more persons. (3) \"Direct relationship\" means that the nature of criminal conduct for which the person was convicted has a direct bearing on his fitness or ability to perform one or more of the duties or responsibilities necessarily related to the license, opportunity, or job in question. (4) \"License\" means any certificate, license, permit or grant of permission required by the laws of this state, its political subdivisions or instrumentalities as a condition for the lawful practice of any occupation, employment, trade, vocation, business, or profession. Provided, however, that \"license\" shall not, for the purposes of this article, include any license or permit to own, possess, carry, or fire any explosive, pistol, handgun, rifle, shotgun, or other firearm. (5) \"Employment\" means any occupation, vocation or employment, or any form of vocational or educational training. Provided, however, that \"employment\" shall not, for the purposes of this article, include membership in any law enforcement agency. \u00a7751. Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply to any application by any person for a license or employment at any public or private employer, who has previously been convicted of one or more criminal offenses in this state or in any other jurisdiction, and to any license or employment held by any person whose conviction of one or more criminal offenses in this state or in any other jurisdiction preceded such employment or granting of a license, except where a mandatory forfeiture, disability or bar to employment is imposed by law, and has not been removed by an executive pardon, certificate of relief from disabilities or certificate of good conduct. Nothing in this article shall be construed to affect any right an employer may have with respect to an intentional misrepresentation in connection with an application for employment made by a prospective employee or previously made by a current employee. \u00a7752. Unfair discrimination against persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses prohibited. No application for any license or employment, and no employment or license held by an individual, to which the provisions of this article are applicable, shall be denied or acted upon adversely by reason of the individual's having been previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses, or by reason of a finding of lack of \"good moral character\" when such finding is based upon the fact that the individual has previously been convicted of one or more criminal offenses, unless: (1) There is a direct relationship between one or more of the previous criminal offenses and the specific license or employment sought or held by the individual; or (2) the issuance or continuation of the license or the granting or continuation of the employment would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public. \u00a7753. Factors to be considered concerning a previous criminal conviction; presumption. 1. In making a determination pursuant to section seven hundred fifty-two of this chapter, the public agency or private employer shall consider the following factors: (a) The public policy of this state, as expressed in this act, to encourage the licensure and employment of persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses. (b) The specific duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the license or employment sought or held by the person. (c) The bearing, if any, the criminal offense or offenses for which the person was previously convicted will have on his fitness or ability to perform one or more such duties or responsibilities. (d) The time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses. (e) The age of the person at the time of occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses. (f) The seriousness of the offense or offenses. (g) Any information produced by the person, or produced on his behalf, in regard to his rehabilitation and good conduct. (h) The legitimate interest of the public agency or private employer in protecting property, and the safety and welfare of specific individuals or the general public. 2. In making a determination pursuant to section seven hundred fifty-two of this chapter, the public agency or private employer shall also give consideration to a certificate of relief from disabilities or a certificate of good conduct issued to the applicant, which certificate shall create a presumption of rehabilitation in regard to the offense or offenses specified therein. \u00a7754. Written statement upon denial of license or employment. At the request of any person previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses who has been denied a license or employment, a public agency or private employer shall provide, within thirty days of a request, a written statement setting forth the reasons for such denial. \u00a7755. Enforcement. 1. In relation to actions by public agencies, the provisions of this article shall be enforceable by a proceeding brought pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules. 2. In relation to actions by private employers, the provisions of this article shall be enforceable by the division of human rights pursuant to the powers and procedures set forth in article fifteen of the executive law, and, concurrently, by the New York city commission on human rights."}, "skillslist": {"skill": [{"id": "7092", "name": "Handguns", "shortname": "Handguns", "type": "TOOL"}, {"id":

Unfair discrimination against persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses prohibited. 753. Factors to be considered concerning a previous criminal conviction; presumption. 754. Written statement upon denial of license or employment. 755. Enforcement. \u00a7750. Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (1) \"Public agency\" means the state or any local subdivision thereof, or any state or local department, agency, board or commission. (2) \"Private employer\" means any person, company, corporation, labor organization or association which employs ten or more persons. (3) \"Direct relationship\" means that the nature of criminal conduct for which the person was convicted has a direct bearing on his fitness or ability to perform one or more of the duties or responsibilities necessarily related to the license, opportunity, or job in question. (4) \"License\" means any certificate, license, permit or grant of permission required by the laws of this state, its political subdivisions or instrumentalities as a condition for the lawful practice of any occupation, employment, trade, vocation, business, or profession. Provided, however, that \"license\" shall not, for the purposes of this article, include any license or permit to own, possess, carry, or fire any explosive, pistol, handgun, rifle, shotgun, or other firearm. (5) \"Employment\" means any occupation, vocation or employment, or any form of vocational or educational training. Provided, however, that \"employment\" shall not, for the purposes of this article, include membership in any law enforcement agency. \u00a7751. Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply to any application by any person for a license or employment at any public or private employer, who has previously been convicted of one or more criminal offenses in this state or in any other jurisdiction, and to any license or employment held by any person whose conviction of one or more criminal offenses in this state or in any other jurisdiction preceded such employment or granting of a license, except where a mandatory forfeiture, disability or bar to employment is imposed by law, and has not been removed by an executive pardon, certificate of relief from disabilities or certificate of good conduct. Nothing in this article shall be construed to affect any right an employer may have with respect to an intentional misrepresentation in connection with an application for employment made by a prospective employee or previously made by a current employee. \u00a7752. Unfair discrimination against persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses prohibited. No application for any license or employment, and no employment or license held by an individual, to which the provisions of this article are applicable, shall be denied or acted upon adversely by reason of the individual's having been previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses, or by reason of a finding of lack of \"good moral character\" when such finding is based upon the fact that the individual has previously been convicted of one or more criminal offenses, unless: (1) There is a direct relationship between one or more of the previous criminal offenses and the specific license or employment sought or held by the individual; or (2) the issuance or continuation of the license or the granting or continuation of the employment would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public. \u00a7753. Factors to be considered concerning a previous criminal conviction; presumption. 1. In making a determination pursuant to section seven hundred fifty-two of this chapter, the public agency or private employer shall consider the following factors: (a) The public policy of this state, as expressed in this act, to encourage the licensure and employment of persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses. (b) The specific duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the license or employment sought or held by the person. (c) The bearing, if any, the criminal offense or offenses for which the person was previously convicted will have on his fitness or ability to perform one or more such duties or responsibilities. (d) The time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses. (e) The age of the person at the time of occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses. (f) The seriousness of the offense or offenses. (g) Any information produced by the person, or produced on his behalf, in regard to his rehabilitation and good conduct. (h) The legitimate interest of the public agency or private employer in protecting property, and the safety and welfare of specific individuals or the general public. 2. In making a determination pursuant to section seven hundred fifty-two of this chapter, the public agency or private employer shall also give consideration to a certificate of relief from disabilities or a certificate of good conduct issued to the applicant, which certificate shall create a presumption of rehabilitation in regard to the offense or offenses specified therein. \u00a7754. Written statement upon denial of license or employment. At the request of any person previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses who has been denied a license or employment, a public agency or private employer shall provide, within thirty days of a request, a written statement setting forth the reasons for such denial. \u00a7755. Enforcement. 1. In relation to actions by public agencies, the provisions of this article shall be enforceable by a proceeding brought pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules. 2. In relation to actions by private employers, the provisions of this article shall be enforceable by the division of human rights pursuant to the powers and procedures set forth in article fifteen of the executive law, and, concurrently, by the New York city commission on human rights."}, "skillslist": {"skill": [{"id": "7092", "name": "Handguns", "shortname": "Handguns", "type": "TOOL"}, {"id": "7103", "name": "Pistols", "shortname": "Pistols", "type": "TOOL"}, {"id": "8223", "name": "Tractor-trailers", "shortname": "Tractor-trailers", "type": "TOOL"}, {"id": "31186", "name": "Bilingual", "shortname": "Bilingual", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "36656", "name": "Public policy", "shortname": "Public policy", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "37446", "name": "Customer experience", "shortname": "Customer experience", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "40711", "name": "Homeland security", "shortname": "Homeland security", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "46027", "name": "Immigration", "shortname": "Immigration", "type": "TECH"}, {"id": "36766", "name": "Law enforcement", "shortname": "Law enforcement", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "37276", "name": "Relationships", "shortname": "Relationships", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44146", "name": "Communication", "shortname": "Communication", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44166", "name": "Courteous", "shortname": "Courteous", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44173", "name": "Customer service", "shortname": "Customer service", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44181", "name": "Determination", "shortname": "Determination", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44261", "name": "Lifting", "shortname": "Lifting", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44286", "name": "Morality", "shortname": "Morality", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44290", "name": "Neatness", "shortname": "Neatness", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44331", "name": "Respect", "shortname": "Respect", "type": "SOFT"}, {"id": "44370", "name": "Transparency", "shortname": "Transparency", "type": "SOFT"}]}, "certificationslist": null, "seniority": {"id": "2", "code": "2", "label": "Mid-level (3-7 yrs)"}, "occupation": {"soc": {"code": "53303300", "label": "Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers", "revision": "2011"}, "occupation": {"code": "53303300", "label": "Light Truck or Delivery Services Drivers", "revision": "2011"}}, "industry": {"code": "492110", "label": "Couriers and Express Delivery Services", "revision": "2012"}, "omjindustries": {"omjindustry": [{"id": "42"}, {"id": "44"}, {"id": "48"}]}, "function": {"id": "16", "label": "Operations / Logistics"}, "employer": {"id": "31154", "name": "FedEx Express", "superaliasid": "23799", "superalias": "FedEx"}, "education": {"id": "8", "label": "High school diploma or equivalent"}, "locations": {"location": [{"city": {"id": "27428", "code": "2756896", "label": "Saint Cloud"}, "state": {"id": "24", "code": "27", "label": "MN"}, "county": {"id": "1316", "code": "27009", "label": "Benton County"}, "wib": {"id": "0", "code": "00000", "label": "Unavailable"}, "msa": {"id": "329", "code": "41060", "label": "St. Cloud"}, "superregion": {"code": "", "label": ""}, "country": {"id": "1", "code": "US", "label": "United States"}, "position": {"latitude": "45.52669906616211", "longitude": "-94.17109680175781"}}]}, "salaries": {"salary": [{"id": "1", "type": "Posted", "value": "37003"}, {"id": "3", "type": "BLS", "value": "24640"}]}, "jobtypes": {"jobtype": [{"id": "4", "label": "Full-Time"}, {"id": "1", "label": "Permanent"}]}, "colleges": {"college": [{"id": ""}]}, "tags": null, "workkeys": {"workkey": [{"id": "1", "label": "Applied Mathematics", "value": "3"}, {"id": "2", "label": "Reading For Information", "value": "3"}, {"id": "3", "label": "Locating Information", "value": "3"}]}, "sources": {"source": [{"id": "1832", "jobid": "4768843546", "tags": "", "type": "Niche", "name": "TweetMyJobs", "url": "https://www.careerarc.com/job-listing/fedex-express-jobs-driver-courier-non-dot-full-time-days-17-79-38848645", "validlink": true}, {"id": "1594", "jobid": "4766384558", "tags": "", "type": "Niche", "name": "Job Monkey", "url": "https://www.jobmonkeyjobs.com/career/21070363/Driver-Courier-Non-Dot-Full-Time-Days-17-79-Minnesota-Saint-Cloud-1255", "validlink": true}]}, "jobscore": {"value": "87"}}, {"id": "4763719436", "hash": "2763726214", "refnumber": "", "isstaffing": false, "isanonymous": false, "isthirdparty": false, "isinappropriate": false, "isbulk": false, "isaggregator": false, "isfree": false, "isclassifiedoccupation": true, "isclassifiedindustry": true, "iscurrent": true, "dates": {"firstseen": "2021-03-17", "lastseen": "2021-03-26", "posted": "2021-03-17", "refreshed": "2021-03-19"}, "title": {"value": "Production Associate- Optical Inspection/Shipping MN Lab-2nd Shift", "titleid": "1148921641", "cleantitleid": "12081258", "semicleantitleid": "424779428"}, "description": {"value": "*Pay* * $14.85 starting pay including shift differential * Higher starting pay with related optical experience *What would you do?

NEW YORK CORRECTION LAW ARTICLE 23-A LICENSURE AND EMPLOYMENT OF PERSONS PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF ONE OR MORE CRIMINAL OFFENSES Section 750. Definitions. 751. Applicability. 752. Unfair discrimination against persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses prohibited. 753. Factors to be considered concerning a previous criminal conviction; presumption. 754. Written statement upon denial of license or employment. 755. Enforcement. \u00a7750. Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (1) \"Public agency\" means the state or any local subdivision thereof, or any state or local department, agency, board or commission. (2) \"Private employer\" means any person, company, corporation, labor organization or association which employs ten or more persons. (3) \"Direct relationship\" means that the nature of criminal conduct for which the person was convicted has a direct bearing on his fitness or ability to perform one or more of the duties or responsibilities necessarily related to the license, opportunity, or job in question. (4) \"License\" means any certificate, license, permit or grant of permission required by the laws of this state, its political subdivisions or instrumentalities as a condition for the lawful practice of any occupation, employment, trade, vocation, business, or profession. Provided, however, that \"license\" shall not, for the purposes of this article, include any license or permit to own, possess, carry, or fire any explosive, pistol, handgun, rifle, shotgun, or other firearm. (5) \"Employment\" means any occupation, vocation or employment, or any form of vocational or educational training. Provided, however, that \"employment\" shall not, for the purposes of this article, include membership in any law enforcement agency. \u00a7751. Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply to any application by any person for a license or employment at any public or private employer, who has previously been convicted of one or more criminal offenses in this state or in any other jurisdiction, and to any license or employment held by any person whose conviction of one or more criminal offenses in this state or in any other jurisdiction preceded such employment or granting of a license, except where a mandatory forfeiture, disability or bar to employment is imposed by law, and has not been removed by an executive pardon, certificate of relief from disabilities or certificate of good conduct. Nothing in this article shall be construed to affect any right an employer may have with respect to an intentional misrepresentation in connection with an application for employment made by a prospective employee or previously made by a current employee. \u00a7752. Unfair discrimination against persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses prohibited.

(2) \"Private employer\" means any person, company, corporation, labor organization or association which employs ten or more persons. (3) \"Direct relationship\" means that the nature of criminal conduct for which the person was convicted has a direct bearing on his fitness or ability to perform one or more of the duties or responsibilities necessarily related to the license, opportunity, or job in question. (4) \"License\" means any certificate, license, permit or grant of permission required by the laws of this state, its political subdivisions or instrumentalities as a condition for the lawful practice of any occupation, employment, trade, vocation, business, or profession. Provided, however, that \"license\" shall not, for the purposes of this article, include any license or permit to own, possess, carry, or fire any explosive, pistol, handgun, rifle, shotgun, or other firearm. (5) \"Employment\" means any occupation, vocation or employment, or any form of vocational or educational training. Provided, however, that \"employment\" shall not, for the purposes of this article, include membership in any law enforcement agency. \u00a7751. Applicability. The provisions of this article shall apply to any application by any person for a license or employment at any public or private employer, who has previously been convicted of one or more criminal offenses in this state or in any other jurisdiction, and to any license or employment held by any person whose conviction of one or more criminal offenses in this state or in any other jurisdiction preceded such employment or granting of a license, except where a mandatory forfeiture, disability or bar to employment is imposed by law, and has not been removed by an executive pardon, certificate of relief from disabilities or certificate of good conduct. Nothing in this article shall be construed to affect any right an employer may have with respect to an intentional misrepresentation in connection with an application for employment made by a prospective employee or previously made by a current employee. \u00a7752. Unfair discrimination against persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses prohibited. No application for any license or employment, and no employment or license held by an individual, to which the provisions of this article are applicable, shall be denied or acted upon adversely by reason of the individual's having been previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses, or by reason of a finding of lack of \"good moral character\" when such finding is based upon the fact that the individual has previously been convicted of one or more criminal offenses, unless: (1) There is a direct relationship between one or more of the previous criminal offenses and the specific license or employment sought or held by the individual; or (2) the issuance or continuation of the license or the granting or continuation of the employment would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public. \u00a7753. Factors to be considered concerning a previous criminal conviction; presumption. 1. In making a determination pursuant to section seven hundred fifty-two of this chapter, the public agency or private employer shall consider the following factors: (a) The public policy of this state, as expressed in this act, to encourage the licensure and employment of persons previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses.

(f) The seriousness of the offense or offenses. (g) Any information produced by the person, or produced on his behalf, in regard to his rehabilitation and good conduct. (h) The legitimate interest of the public agency or private employer in protecting property, and the safety and welfare of specific individuals or the general public. 2. In making a determination pursuant to section seven hundred fifty-two of this chapter, the public agency or private employer shall also give consideration to a certificate of relief from disabilities or a certificate of good conduct issued to the applicant, which certificate shall create a presumption of rehabilitation in regard to the offense or offenses specified therein. \u00a7754. Written statement upon denial of license or employment. At the request of any person previously convicted of one or more criminal offenses who has been denied a license or employment, a public agency or private employer shall provide, within thirty days of a request, a written statement setting forth the reasons for such denial. \u00a7755. Enforcement. 1. In relation to actions by public agencies, the provisions of this article shall be enforceable by a proceeding brought pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules. 2. In relation to actions by private employers, the provisions of this article shall be enforceable by the division of human rights pursuant to the powers and procedures set forth in article fifteen of the executive law, and, concurrently, by the New York city commission on human rights."}, "skillslist": {"skill": [{"id": "7092", "name": "Handguns", "shortname": "Handguns", "type": "TOOL"}, {"id":
