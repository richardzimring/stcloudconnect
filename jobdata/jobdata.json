We are looking for customer service focused sales reps to work from home, with the option to work full time. Interview, train, and work from home. WHAT DO YOUR PART TIME OPENINGS INVOLVE? Our openings are for entry level customer sales/service positions. The work involves fun, laidback presentations with our customers, done virtually. Our products are made in the USA, super high quality, easy-to-explain, and guaranteed forever so our customers love them. There is no cost to start working or any upfront fees. Representatives can be themselves and not worry about being an stereotypical salesperson. WHAT\u2019S THE PAY AND WHAT ARE THE HOURS? The pay starts at $17.00 base-appt. Let me be clear on this point: that is a flat rate, not based on sales or commissions. Some conditions apply. Unfortunately there are no benefits as this is an entry level position. Most people start with ZERO experience. New team members always say our simple, fun training gives them all the confidence they need. We look for people that want to improve their resume and communication skills, not just those who want to make money (we DO offer pay-raises for top performers). Hours are 100% flexible: days/evenings/weekends/part time/& more. HOW DO I FIND MORE INFORMATION? All ages eighteen and up are invited to interview virtually. All you have to do is click here to apply online. A staff member will reach out to you via text to set you up with an interview with our company. You do NOT need any experience to apply. However, we are filling openings *immediately* so don\u2019t delay. If you're eager to learn and looking for resume experience, we might be a good fit for each other.

And ~40% of students drop out? Poor \u201csocial fit\u201d is cited as one of the top 3 biggest reasons for these - help prospective students understand what it\u2019s really like on your school\u2019s campus! **Responsibilities:** - Create your profile to highlight specific areas/interests that you can speak to prospective students about (e.g. your current major, student government, dorm life, greek life, athletics). - Set your calendar and keep it up to date so prospective students can find times that you are available to share your experiences with them! - Accept requests from prospective students to hop on an audio/video call to answer questions they have about your experience at college. For those that don't have specific questions, we will provide some common \"informational chat\" questions that help prospective students get a better picture of what college is really like! **Skills you'll learn:** - \"Your pitch\" - Refine the way that you introduce yourself and share your experiences (great practice for how to pitch yourself in future job interviews) - we provide some great resources that can help if you want to use them! - Presentation skills - Learn to lead a Q&A and highlight exciting characteristics about your school and its culture - Leadership - Become a campus leader and help prospective students everywhere connect with your school. - Time management - Set and manage your own schedule.
