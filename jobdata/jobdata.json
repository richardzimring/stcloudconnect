Experience refers to paid and unpaid experience, including volunteer work done through National Service programs (e.g., Peace Corps, AmeriCorps) and other organizations (e.g., professional; philanthropic; religions; spiritual; community; student; social). Volunteer work helps build critical competencies, knowledge, and skills and can provide valuable training and experience that translates directly to paid employment.

We are looking for customer service focused sales reps to work from home, with the option to work full time. Interview, train, and work from home. WHAT DO YOUR PART TIME OPENINGS INVOLVE? Our openings are for entry level customer sales/service positions. The work involves fun, laidback presentations with our customers, done virtually. Our products are made in the USA, super high quality, easy-to-explain, and guaranteed forever so our customers love them. There is no cost to start working or any upfront fees. Representatives can be themselves and not worry about being an stereotypical salesperson. WHAT\u2019S THE PAY AND WHAT ARE THE HOURS? The pay starts at $17.00 base-appt. Let me be clear on this point: that is a flat rate, not based on sales or commissions. Some conditions apply. Unfortunately there are no benefits as this is an entry level position. Most people start with ZERO experience. New team members always say our simple, fun training gives them all the confidence they need. We look for people that want to improve their resume and communication skills, not just those who want to make money (we DO offer pay-raises for top performers). Hours are 100% flexible: days/evenings/weekends/part time/& more. HOW DO I FIND MORE INFORMATION? All ages eighteen and up are invited to interview virtually. All you have to do is click here to apply online. A staff member will reach out to you via text to set you up with an interview with our company. You do NOT need any experience to apply. However, we are filling openings *immediately* so don\u2019t delay. If you're eager to learn and looking for resume experience, we might be a good fit for each other.
